##  Web Technology(UE19CS204) - MINI PROJECT

### GroFarm

In this era of internet, E-commerce is growing by leaps and bounds. Businesses are resorting to having a counterpart which is internet or E-commerce driven. People in the world now use E-commerce websites on a daily basis to make their everyday purchases. Especially now, COVID-19 is forcing the entire market to shift online.
 
 
In this project we aim to develop a website and optimize existing solutions to deliver fruits and vegetables fresh to our homes. Our unique user friendly website will eliminate the middleman and allow for efficient ‘sell and purchase’ between farmers and consumers. This is extremely valid in today’s scenario considering the situation that farmers are in right now.
